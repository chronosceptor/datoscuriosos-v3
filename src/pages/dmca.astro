							This Digital Millennium Copyright Act policy
							(“Policy”) applies to the datoscuriosos.org website
							(“Website” or “Service”) and any of its related
							products and services (collectively, “Services”) and
							outlines how this Website operator (“Operator”,
							“we”, “us” or “our”) addresses copyright
							infringement notifications and how you (“you” or
							“your”) may submit a copyright infringement
							complaint.
						</p>
						<p>
							Protection of intellectual property is of utmost
							importance to us and we ask our users and their
							authorized agents to do the same. It is our policy
							to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of
							alleged copyright infringement that comply with the
							United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act
							(“DMCA”) of 1998, the text of which can be found at
							the U.S. Copyright Office website. This DMCA policy
							was created with the help of WebsitePolicies.com

							What to consider before submitting a copyright
							complaint
						</h2>
						<p>
							Before submitting a copyright complaint to us,
							consider whether the use could be considered fair
							use. Fair use states that brief excerpts of
							copyrighted material may, under certain
							circumstances, be quoted verbatim for purposes such
							as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and
							research, without the need for permission from or
							payment to the copyright holder.
						</p>
						<p>
							Please note that if you are unsure whether the
							material you are reporting is in fact infringing,
							you may wish to contact an attorney before filing a
							notification with us.
						</p>
						<p>
							The DMCA requires you to provide your personal
							information in the copyright infringement
							notification. If you are concerned about the privacy
							of your personal information, you may wish to hire
							an agent to report infringing material for you.
						</p>
						<h2 id="notifications-of-infringement">
							Notifications of infringement
						</h2>
						<p>
							If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof,
							and you believe that any material available on our
							Services infringes your copyrights, then you may
							submit a written copyright infringement notification
							(“Notification”) using the contact details below
							pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must
							comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to
							a DMCA takedown notice generator or other similar
							services to avoid making mistake and ensure
							compliance of your Notification.
						</p>
						<p>
							Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a
							pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be
							reviewed for accuracy, validity, and completeness.
							If your complaint has satisfied these requirements,
							our response may include the removal or restriction
							of access to allegedly infringing material.
						</p>
						<p>
							If we remove or restrict access to materials or
							terminate an account in response to a Notification
							of alleged infringement, we will make a good faith
							effort to contact the affected user with information
							concerning the removal or restriction of access.
						</p>
						<p>
							Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
							in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves
							the right to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA
							copyright infringement notification if it fails to
							comply with all the requirements of the DMCA for
							such notifications.
						</p>
						<p>
							The process described in this Policy does not limit
							our ability to pursue any other remedies we may have
							to address suspected infringement.
						</p>
						<h2 id="changes-and-amendments">
							Changes and amendments
						</h2>
						<p>
							We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its
							terms related to the Website and Services at any
							time at our discretion. When we do, we will revise
							the updated date at the bottom of this page. We may
							also provide notice to you in other ways at our
							discretion, such as through the contact information
							you have provided.
						</p>
						<p>
							An updated version of this Policy will be effective
							immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy
							unless otherwise specified. Your continued use of
							the Website and Services after the effective date of
							the revised Policy (or such other act specified at
							that time) will constitute your consent to those
							changes.
						</p>
						<p>Reporting copyright infringement</p>
